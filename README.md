# Linear_Stock_market_predictor_model
We apply a simple linear model to predicting the stock market. We also compare the modelâ€™s performance (in terms of root mean squared error) on the data. Project completed as part of homework 4 of CSE 250A of UCSD, CSE, Fall 2022.

# Tasks: 
For a detailed description of the model and tasks in this project, please refer to the file 'Problem Statement.pdf'. Roughly part a tells us to measure the accuracy of measurements of the index of a particular day in terms of the preceding three days and part b tells us to measure root mean squared prediction error. 

#Files :
1. hw4_nasdaq00.txt, hw4_nasdaq01.txt: text file with the information about stock market data. 
2. Problem Statement.pdf: The detailed problem statement with each part indicated.
3. code.ipynb: The code to solve the problem parts as given in 'Problem Statement.pdf'.

#Execution :
Execute code.ipynb notebook according to parts given in 'Problem Statement.pdf'. You may have to run the previous part's code before going to the next part.
